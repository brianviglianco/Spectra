# SPECTRAL - Continuous Privacy Compliance Verification

🔍 **The only platform that proves your privacy policies are actually enforced in production**

## What is SPECTRAL?

SPECTRAL is a continuous verification platform that automatically checks—with reproducible evidence—whether websites, apps, and CTV experiences truly behave according to user consent and privacy policies. It operates across all regions, consent states (none/accept/reject/GPC), and covers both client and server sides.

## 🎯 Core Value Proposition

- **Continuous Runtime Verification** - 24/7 monitoring vs point-in-time audits
- **Client ↔ Server Correlation** - Ensures same legal state on both sides  
- **Evidence-First Reporting** - Screenshots, HAR files, reproducible proof
- **Multi-Surface Coverage** - Web, mobile SDK, CTV in single platform
- **CI/CD Integration** - Block releases with critical violations

## 🏗️ Project Status

**Current Phase:** MVP Development  
**Timeline:** 3 weeks to demo-ready product  
**Recommendation:** PROCEED with 78% confidence
